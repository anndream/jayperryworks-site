These [playgrounds by Danish architecture firm Monstrum](https://www.1843magazine.com/design/the-designers-having-fun-with-playgrounds) for the Lego House rooftop look amazing. I especially like that these spaces don't just look like fun, but they also suggest stories. A great place to play but also to pretend.
