    ['Giclee'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gicl√©e) is a term for high-quality digital prints. Mine are printed at [Archival Arts](http://archivalarts.com) in Baltimore on heavy, textured, acid-free cotton rag paper, using archival, pigment-based inks. All prints are individually signed and numbered.
