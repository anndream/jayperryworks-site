This piece shows the kind of landscape I see often on drives to my hometown in the Shenanadoah Valley, Virginia. I usually end up making the trip late at night, and I've always loved seeing the stars come out over the mountains as I get farther from the city. I get a lot of good thinking done on these drives.
