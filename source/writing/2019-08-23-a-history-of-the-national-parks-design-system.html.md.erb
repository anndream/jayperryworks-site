Oh dear Lord I want [this book](https://standardsmanual.com/products/parks).

I remember those “Helvetica + black stripe” pamphlets and maps from my childhood (esp the Appalachian Trail and Shenandoah ones - which I think are still printed) - I had no idea that they were actually part of a giant design system developed by Massimo Vignelli’s studio.

This is one of those connecting threads between my hayseed middle-of-nowhere childhood and the supposedly bigger world I’m aware of now that just kind of gives me chills.

More about Vignelli’s [design system for park publications](https://www.fastcompany.com/3027714/how-the-creator-of-nycs-hated-subway-map-redesigned-our-nations-parks).
