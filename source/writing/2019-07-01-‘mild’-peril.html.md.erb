I watched an animated movie with my 4-year-old daughter tonight and, as it started, I noticed the MPAA rating as it flashed by: RATED ‘G’ FOR MILD PERIL. For some reason the phrase MILD PERIL got stuck in a kind of processing loop in my head. Maybe because I’ve always thought of peril as a binary state: either I’m in peril or I’m, you know, okay. I never really thought of it as something that needed to be qualified.

So what does it mean to find oneself in ‘mild’ peril? As I asked myself this question, I realized that I would now be helpless to stop myself from spending the rest of this movie devising Peril Scales. I eventually landed on something like this:

- **Mild peril**: We’re out of coffee.
- **Moderate peril**: We’re out of water.
- **Severe peril**: We’re out of air.

Or maybe:

- **Mild peril**: Angry badger.
- **Moderate peril**: Angry wolverine.
- **Severe peril**: Angry elephant.

Or maybe:

- **Mild peril**: Sir Galahad.
- **Moderate peril**: Sir Lancelot.
- **Severe peril**: The Black Knight. (Alright, we’ll call it a draw.)

You get the idea.

By the end of our movie, the main characters had been close enough to an exploding car to lose eyebrows and/or hearing, nearly run over by both a delivery truck and a train, and were nearly killed in a burning building. I don’t know what scale the MPAA is going by but I would have to call that something more than mild peril.
