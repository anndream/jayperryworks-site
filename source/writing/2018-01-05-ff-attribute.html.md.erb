“[FF Attribute](https://www.myfonts.com/search/name%3Aattribute/fonts/)” is a new sans family with both [monospace](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-attribute-mono/) and [regular](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-attribute-text/) (kerned) versions — this is not unusual, per se, except that the two versions use (what looks like) almost identical character sets. One character set is versatile enough to do double duty as either text or code, with minimal modification.
